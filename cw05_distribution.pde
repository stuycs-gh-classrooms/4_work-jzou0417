/* ===================
  This program, when completed, will populate 2 arrays randomly
  using different techniques and draw them as bar graphs as they
  change over time

  This assignment is broken up into 3 parts. The code you
  need to complete each part is clearly labeled. Do not
  move to a new part until you have completed the previous
  ones.

  PART 0: Add 1 to a radomly chosen index of an array in draw().

  PART 1: Display 1 array as a bar graph with a specified y-coordinte
          for the baseline of all the bars.

  PART 2: Randomly select an index from a second array using a
          different technique (described bellow).

  PART 3: Draw both arrays as bar graphs on the same screen,
          splitting the screen in half.

  PART 4: Write a method to calculate the average  of the
          elements in an array.

  PART 5: Using the average method you wrote, draw a line on each
          bar graph across the screen at the average value.
